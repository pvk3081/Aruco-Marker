                                         ArUco Markers

An ArUco marker is a synthetic square marker composed by a wide black border and an inner binary matrix which determines its identifier (id). The black border facilitates its fast detection in the image and the binary codification allows its identification and the application of error detection and correction techniques. The marker size determines the size of the internal matrix. For instance a marker size of 4x4 is composed by 16 bits.

Applications - 
We had tried using Aruco markers for the landing purpose of our drones. After identifying the markers the drone would get the distance of the Aruco marker from the drone and take the actions accordingly.
